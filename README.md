<h2>Toronto Housing Market</h2>
  
Welcome to the Toronto Housing Market Analysis repository! This project was created as part of my Master's in Data Science and Analytics program
at Toronto Metropolitan University in 2023. The goal of the project is to analyze the housing market in Toronto, Canada,
using various data science techniques.
The data directory contains raw and cleaned data related to different housing types, such as single-family attached, single-family detached, apartment, and townhouse, as well as demographics in Toronto. The data was sourced from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TREB).

<h2>Docs:</h2> This directory contains documentation files,
including a PDF report detailing the methodology and findings of the project and
presentation file.

visualization using Python and various libraries, the project aims to provide insights that can be useful for real estate investors, 
developers, and anyone interested in the Toronto housing market.
